            <h2>What is iCare?</h2>
            <p>iCare is a research initiative focused on improving feeding practices in babies. Our goal is to understand what
                challenges parents are having feeding their babies and develop supportive resources and tools to help them include 
                a wide variety of foods, including important allergens like egg and peanut. Drawing from parent experiences and ongoing 
                research, the study aims to address common misconceptions, reduce fear, and support both families and pediatricians in
                increasing diet diversity and reducing food allergies.</p>

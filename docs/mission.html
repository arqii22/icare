        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to support families in preventing food allergies and improving gut health through greater 
            understanding, clearer guidance, and stronger communication.
            <br>
            <br>
            We believe that every parent deserves access to simple, trustworthy information—especially
            when it comes to their child’s health. Feeding children peanuts and eggs early in life to prevent
            allergies is a powerful tool backed by science, but we know that understanding it, but we know that
            understanding it—and putting it into practice—can feel confusing or even scary.
            <br>
            <br>
            Through the iCare Study, we aim to bridge the gap between medical recommendations and 
            everyday parenting. By listening to real families and identifying the challenges they 
            face, our goal is to make these guidelines easy to understand and incorporate into daily life.
            <br>
            <br>
            We are committed to:
            <ul>
                <li>Learning from parents and caregivers</li>
                <li>Empowering families with knowledge</li>
                <li>Helping healthcare providers communicate more clearly</li>
                <li>Reducing preventable cases of peanut allergy in children</li>
                <li>Improving early infant nutrition and diet diversity</li>
            </ul>
            Together, we can create a future where families feel confident taking early steps to protect 
            their children—and where more children can grow up without the burden of food allergies or other chronic
            conditions related to poor gut health.

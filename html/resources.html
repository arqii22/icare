            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="faq">
                <button class="accordion">+ What is EPPI?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>EPPI (Early Peanut Product Introduction) refers to introducing peanut-containing foods to infants
                        early in life—usually around 4 to 6 months old—to help prevent the development of
                        peanut allergy.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">+ Why introduce peanuts early?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Groundbreaking studies like the LEAP trial showed that introducing peanuts
                        early to high-risk infants reduced the chance of developing a peanut allergy
                        by up to 81%. It’s now considered an important public health measure.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">+ What is diet diversity?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Diet diversity refers to the variety of foods consumed within a diet. Recommendation says that once 
                        complementary foods are introduced to an infant (around 6 months of age, but not before 4 months),
                        the introduction of allergenic foods (e.g. peanuts, fish, sesame, wheat) can help prevent food 
                        allergies.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">+ Is this study safe for my child?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>We understand the fear, but research shows that early introduction—when done
                        safely and appropriately—actually lowers the risk of developing a peanut allergy.
                        If your baby has severe eczema or a known egg allergy, it’s best to consult your
                        pediatrician before starting.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">+ Is early peanut introduction the same as allergy testing?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>No. EPPI is meant to <b>prevent</b> peanut allergy - not test for it. It's a long-term strategy,
                        not a one-time trial</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">+ How do I know if my baby is high risk for peanut allergy?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Babies with moderate to severe eczema (atopic dermatitis) or existing food
                        allergies (like to eggs) are considered higher risk. Even if there’s no family
                        history, eczema alone is a major risk factor.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">+ What if I don’t have a history of food allergies in my family?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Family history isn’t the only factor. Many parents in our study thought their
                        baby was low risk because food allergies didn’t “run in the family,” but eczema
                        and other signs of atopy can still increase risk.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">+ How much peanut product should I give, and how often?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Talk to your pediatrician about what’s best for your baby.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">+ What if I’m scared of a severe reaction?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>You’re not alone—fear of allergic reaction was the biggest barrier in our study.
                        Taking precautions like having an emergency plan, and talking with your pediatrician
                        can help ease that fear.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">+ I didn’t hear about EPPI from my doctor—why not?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Some pediatricians may not have time to cover everything in one visit, or they
                        may assume parents already know. This is why better communication and simple,
                        clear resources are so important—and part of what the iCare study hopes to
                        improve.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">+ Is it too late to start if my baby is already 9–12 months?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Not necessarily. While earlier is better, introducing peanuts during infancy—even
                        later in the first year—can still be helpful. Talk with your pediatrician for guidance
                        based on your child’s health history.</p>

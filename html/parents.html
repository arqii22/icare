        <h2>Understanding Parents</h2>
        <p>We conducted in-depth interviews with 49 English-speaking parents of babies between 8 and 13
            months old in the Chicago area between September 2023 and September 2024. These were
            qualitative interviews, meaning we focused on the "how" and "why" behind parental
            decision-making—how parents went about starting solid foods for their children, challenges they faced
            and, how they applied food allergy prevention guidelines like early peanut introduction. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Our participants represented a diverse range of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic
            backgrounds:

            <ul>
                <li>43% White, 29% Black, 29% Hispanic/Latino, 8% Asian, and 2% Native American</li>
                <li>Wide range of educational backgrounds and professions</li>
                <li>Families included those with both private and public insurance</li> 
                <li>Included both single-parent and two-parent households</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Why This Study Matters</h3>
        <p>The iCare Study seeks to shed light on these challenges so that healthcare providers and
            public health leaders can better support families during solid food introduction. By identifying 
            where confusion, fear, and misinformation arise—and understanding what helps parents feel prepared—we hope to
            close the gap between medical guidelines and everyday practice.
            <br>
            <br>
            This study is more than just research—it’s about listening to parents’ voices, honoring
            their concerns, and working together toward a future where more children can grow up free
            from the burden of food allergies.

        <h3>What We Discovered</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Parents trust the information their pediatrician provides but need more details, instructions, recipes, and support</li>
                <li>Parents want to know what resources online are reliable and backed by science</li>
                <li>Learning how to make a family meal would save a lot of time and make feeding a baby homemade food
                    more feasible</li>
                <li>Parents want to give their baby a good start and avoid processed foods</li>
                <li>Parents are worried about choking and food allergies</li>
                <li>Many parents had heard of early peanut introduction, but some do not understand its
                    purpose is to prevent food allergies</li>
                <li>Many parents are not informed about eczema and its connection to food allergies</li>
            </ul>
